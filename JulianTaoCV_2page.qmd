# Relevant Qualifications, Capabilities, and Experiences


I am the director of the research group Bio-inspired Geotechnics (BiG) in the NSF Research Center for Bio-mediated and Bio-inspired Geotechnics at Arizona State University.
We seek the answers at the boundaries of biology, mechanics and engineering. We achieve the BiG goals and extend the impacts from research, teaching, outreach, entrepreneurship and collaboration.
Our Current research topics include: bio-inspired self-burrowing robots, bio-inspired underground sensing and communication, bio-inspired sustainable countermeasures to natural hazards.

I have secured about \$2M awards as a PI, published over 100 research papers, mentored about 20 graduate students, about 30 undergraduate and high school students, and a number of high-school teachers. Among all my mentees, about 1/3 are from underrepresented groups.

\vspace{1em}

My leadership is demonstrated through organizing the upcoming International Conference on Bio-mediated and Bio-inspired Geotechnics, and co-editing several proceedings and special journal issues in bio-inspired geotechnics.
