I have participated in organizing or chairing **`r nconf_participated`** technical conferences or sessions, served on **`r ncommittee_profession`** technical committees, and reviewed for **`r nreview_journal`** journals, **`r nreview_agency`** funding agencies. I also volunteered in **`r noutreach`** outreach activities.

# Patents, Publications, and Invited Talks

Since 2009, I have authored **`r npub`** research publications, including **`r narticle`** journal papers, **`r nproceeding`** conference papers, and **`r nreport`** technical reports, co-edited **`r nbook`** books, and filed **`r npatent`** patents.
I also have delivered **`r ntalk`** invited talks to universities, local, national and international conferences.
As of `r format(Sys.time(), "%B %e, %Y")`, my h-index is **`r jtcite$All[2]`** and i10-index is **`r jtcite$All[3]`**, with total citations of **`r prettyNum(jtcite$All[1], big.mark=",")`**. (**Bold**: PhD student, ^#^: undergrad student, ^\*^: corresponding)
