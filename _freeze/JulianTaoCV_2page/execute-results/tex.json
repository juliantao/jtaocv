We achieve the BiG goals and extend the impacts from research, teaching, outreach, entrepreneurship and collaboration.\nOur Current research topics include: bio-inspired self-burrowing robots, bio-inspired underground sensing and communication, bio-inspired sustainable countermeasures to natural hazards.\n\n\\vspace{1em}\n\nI have secured about \\$2M awards as a PI, published over 100 research papers, mentored about 20 graduate students, about 30 undergraduate and high school students, and a number of high-school teachers. Among all my mentees, about 1/3 are from underrepresented groups.\n\n\\vspace{1em}\n\nMy leadership is demonstrated through organizing the upcoming International Conference on Bio-mediated and Bio-inspired Geotechnics, and co-editing several proceedings and special journal issues in bio-inspired geotechnics.\n\n\n",
