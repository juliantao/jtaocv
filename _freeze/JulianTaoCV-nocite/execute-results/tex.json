We achieve the BiG goals and extend the impacts from research, teaching, outreach, entrepreneurship and collaboration.\nOur Current research topics include: bio-inspired self-burrowing robots, bio-inspired underground sensing and communication, bio-inspired sustainable countermeasures to natural hazards.\n\n# Professional Membership\n\n\\begin{longtable}{p{1.5in}p{6in}}\n  Associate Member & American Society of Civil Engineers (ASCE) Geo-Institute \\\\ \n  Member & International Society for Soil Mechanics and Geotechnical Engineering (ISSMGE) \\\\ \n  Member & Society for Integrative and Comparative Biology (SICB) \\\\ \n  Member & Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE) \\\\ \n  Member & International Society for Optical Engineering (SPIE) \\\\ \n  Member & Transportation Research Board (TRB) \\\\ \n  \\end{longtable}\n\n\\vspace{2em}\n\n\\part*{\\uppercase{Publications, Intellectual Property and Presentations}}\n\n## Summary of Publications and Intellectual Property\n\n\\begin{longtable}{p{4in}l}\n  Total Publications & 115 \\\\ \n  Books Co-Edited & 3 \\\\ \n  Invited Journal Publications & 1 \\\\ \n  Invited Conference Papers & 3 \\\\ \n  Refereed Conference Papers & 66 \\\\ \n  Technical Reports or other papers (non-refereed) & 5 \\\\ \n  Journal publications from ASU & 23 \\\\ \n  Journal Publications Prior to ASU (All Published) & 21 \\\\ \n  Manuscripts Submitted or In Revision from ASU & 4 \\\\ \n  Patents;
