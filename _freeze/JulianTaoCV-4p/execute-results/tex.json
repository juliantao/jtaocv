We achieve the BiG goals and extend the impacts from research, teaching, outreach, entrepreneurship and collaboration.\nOur Current research topics include: bio-inspired self-burrowing robots, bio-inspired underground sensing and communication, bio-inspired sustainable countermeasures to natural hazards.\n\n# Professional Membership\n\n\\begin{longtable}{p{1.5in}p{6in}}\n  Associate Member & American Society of Civil Engineers (ASCE) Geo-Institute \\\\ \n  Member & International Society for Soil Mechanics and Geotechnical Engineering (ISSMGE) \\\\ \n  Member & Society for Integrative and Comparative Biology (SICB) \\\\ \n  Member & Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE) \\\\ \n  Member & International Society for Optical Engineering (SPIE) \\\\ \n  Member & Transportation Research Board (TRB) \\\\ \n  \\end{longtable}\n\n\\vspace{1.5em}\n\n\\part*{\\uppercase{Publications, Intellectual Property and Invited Talks}}\n\nSince 2009, I have authored **115** research publications, including **44** journal papers, **66** conference papers, and **5** technical reports, co-edited **3** books, and filed **2** patents.\nI also have delivered **36** invited talks to universities, local, national and international conferences.\nAs of **January 21, 2025**, my h-index is **19** and i10-index is **34**, with total citations of **1,714**. **Only publications on bio-inspired geotechnics are included below.**\n\n# Journal Articles on Bio-inspired Geotechnics [^1]\n\n[^1]: **Bold**: PhD student, \\underline{Underline}: MS student,  ^#^: undergrad student, $^\\infty$: visiting student, $^\\times$: PostDoc, ^\\*^: corresponding\n\n\\begin{refsection}\\nocite{5jpoy} \\nocite{77lst} \\nocite{7g3kl} \\nocite{90rt1} \\nocite{al5ne} \\nocite{apk1s} \\nocite{bcyyx} \\nocite{bqhij} \\nocite{e3l65} \\nocite{h1qpi} \\nocite{my9wm} \\nocite{nlndm} \\nocite{s0aqd} \\nocite{tcv33} \\nocite{ugjea} \\nocite{wc1ri} \\nocite{wug7n} \\nocite{xieyr}\\printbibliography[heading=none]\\end{refsection}\n\n# Editorial or Opinion Articles on Bio-inspired Geotechnics\n\n\\begin{refsection}\\nocite{3f44z} \\nocite{mvsd5}\\printbibliography[heading=none]\\end{refsection}\n\n# Conference Papers on Bio-inspired Geotechnics [^2]\n\n[^2]: **Bold**: PhD student, \\underline{Underline}: MS student,  ^#^: undergrad student, $^\\infty$: visiting student, $^\\times$: PostDoc, ^\\*^: corresponding, $^\\sim$: presentor\n\n\\begin{refsection}\\nocite{0mr41} \\nocite{3hm17} \\nocite{3ng1v} \\nocite{74f47} \\nocite{86hdg} \\nocite{8fgmd} \\nocite{ank8w} \\nocite{c0rze} \\nocite{cbudp} \\nocite{ctug9} \\nocite{eao7r} \\nocite{f0h7l} \\nocite{jol0m} \\nocite{k3vwf} \\nocite{k82mr} \\nocite{mpws9} \\nocite{ocbv8} \\nocite{pf8gi} \\nocite{rklzc} \\nocite{s7x61} \\nocite{syi7o} \\nocite{vitgm} \\nocite{vmh06} \\nocite{x6gyn} \\nocite{yynvc}\\printbibliography[heading=none]\\end{refsection}\n\n# Patents on Bio-inspired Geotechnics\n\n\\begin{refsection}\\nocite{1lx50} \\nocite{isurj}\\printbibliography[heading=none]\\end{refsection}\n\n\\vspace{1.5em}\n\n\\part*{\\uppercase{Professional activities and service}}\n\nI served as an Editor or Guest Editor for **3** peer-reviewed journals or journal special issues and currently serving on an Editorial Board for **1** journal.
