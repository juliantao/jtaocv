We achieve the BiG goals and extend the impacts from research, teaching, outreach, entrepreneurship and collaboration.\nCurrent research topics include: bio-inspired self-burrowing robots, bio-inspired underground sensing and communication, bio-inspired sustainable countermeasures to natural hazards.\n\n# Professional Membership\n\n\n\\begin{longtable}{p{1.5in}p{6in}}\n  Associate Member & American Society of Civil Engineers (ASCE) Geo-Institute \\\\ \n  Member & International Society for Soil Mechanics and Geotechnical Engineering (ISSMGE) \\\\ \n  Member & Society for Integrative and Comparative Biology (SICB) \\\\ \n  Member & Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE) \\\\ \n  Member & International Society for Optical Engineering (SPIE) \\\\ \n  Member & Transportation Research Board (TRB) \\\\ \n  \\end{longtable}\n\n\n\\part*{\\uppercase{Publications, Intellectual Property and Presentations}}\n\n## Summary of Publications and Intellectual Property\n\n\n\\begin{longtable}{p{4in}l}\n  Books Co-Edited & 3 \\\\ \n  Invited Journal Publications & 1 \\\\ \n  Invited Conference Papers & 3 \\\\ \n  Refereed Conference Papers & 65 \\\\ \n  Technical Reports or other papers (non-refereed) & 5 \\\\ \n  Journal publications from ASU & 19 \\\\ \n  Journal Publications Prior to ASU (All Published) & 21 \\\\ \n  Manuscripts Submitted or In Revision from ASU & 5 \\\\ \n  Patents; Patents pending & 2 \\\\ \n  \\end{longtable}\n\n\n## Summary of Presentations \n\n\n\\begin{longtable}{p{4in}l}\n  Invited Presentation, External & 30 \\\\ \n  Invited Presentation, Internal & 2 \\\\ \n  Peer-reviewed Conference Presentations, including Students & 51 \\\\ \n  \\end{longtable}\n\n\\vspace{1ex}\n\nSince 2009 I have authored 111 research publications and filed 2 patents.\nAs of April 18, 2023, my h-index is 17 and i10-index is 27, with total citations of 1,152.\n\n\n# Journal Papers\n\n\n\\begin{refsection}\\nocite{0t3np} \\nocite{0zhe7} \\nocite{141gl} \\nocite{1bz7m} \\nocite{23r66} \\nocite{5fav7} \\nocite{68aen} \\nocite{7ef8k} \\nocite{7pj82} \\nocite{7voww} \\nocite{888zh} \\nocite{8buuq} \\nocite{b0drn} \\nocite{cbdmb} \\nocite{cyvn4} \\nocite{dgnun} \\nocite{dwq57} \\nocite{e7pg2} \\nocite{h7k14} \\nocite{hcwef} \\nocite{jjrq2} \\nocite{kx05h} \\nocite{kxohf} \\nocite{lhbij} \\nocite{mt00i} \\nocite{muvix} \\nocite{sdtyu} \\nocite{semaz} \\nocite{sfjs0} \\nocite{tqukq} \\nocite{tro8o} \\nocite{uz2dx} \\nocite{vgetr} \\nocite{vhj74} \\nocite{w2x7z} \\nocite{w5z8o} \\nocite{x4u4q} \\nocite{y5t98} \\nocite{yg4cp} \\nocite{zkc8m}\\printbibliography[heading=none]\\end{refsection}\n\n\n# Papers in Refereed Conference Proceedings\n\n\n\\begin{refsection}\\nocite{0yxei} \\nocite{0zj9x} \\nocite{1225g} \\nocite{15ehb} \\nocite{1efxh} \\nocite{2lv5h} \\nocite{2u97w} \\nocite{2wisp} \\nocite{2zxor} \\nocite{36aeg} \\nocite{3u02q} \\nocite{3wl60} \\nocite{5gweq} \\nocite{5jyur} \\nocite{6i13v} \\nocite{7a37y} \\nocite{7kfpi} \\nocite{atotm} \\nocite{b2qhg} \\nocite{bk84h} \\nocite{bmfjb} \\nocite{eiuv6} \\nocite{f6ui1} \\nocite{f7py5} \\nocite{f7qkm} \\nocite{gqqx5} \\nocite{guna0} \\nocite{h8jq0} \\nocite{h8vuu} \\nocite{hzq58} \\nocite{iy3ny} \\nocite{j0kmh} \\nocite{j231r} \\nocite{j73hb} \\nocite{j8hg6} \\nocite{jzf5a} \\nocite{k99yi} \\nocite{kht1k} \\nocite{l8v1s} \\nocite{la09d} \\nocite{mb49c} \\nocite{n3snh} \\nocite{n40py} \\nocite{nuhwr} \\nocite{nv2ou} \\nocite{p6sn6} \\nocite{pkqzz} \\nocite{qmltv} \\nocite{qwtoi} \\nocite{sb9r8} \\nocite{t1323} \\nocite{tca43} \\nocite{uc8dc} \\nocite{udls6} \\nocite{ue5uy} \\nocite{uhkkj} \\nocite{valbk} \\nocite{vkb2u} \\nocite{vy0rf} \\nocite{wpuny} \\nocite{xktq3} \\nocite{xr22m} \\nocite{yoxw0} \\nocite{zbptp} \\nocite{zlfgr}\\printbibliography[heading=none]\\end{refsection}\n\n\n# Edited Books\n\n\n\\begin{refsection}\\nocite{1bivb} \\nocite{8o4yr} \\nocite{rqx6h}\\printbibliography[heading=none]\\end{refsection}\n\n\n# Technical Reports\n\n\n\\begin{refsection}\\nocite{5tqeh} \\nocite{ev8bp} \\nocite{kdzmm} \\nocite{rdpov} \\nocite{tbsiv}\\printbibliography[heading=none]\\end{refsection}\n\n\n# PhD Thesis\n\n\n\\begin{refsection}\\nocite{uohn2}\\printbibliography[heading=none]\\end{refsection}\n\n\n# Patents\n\n\n\\begin{refsection}\\nocite{jskio} \\nocite{v3btt}\\printbibliography[heading=none]\\end{refsection}\n\n\n# Invited Talks\n\n\n\\begin{longtable}{p{0.7in}p{6in}}\n  2022--12 & Short Course on Bio-inspired Geotechnics.
